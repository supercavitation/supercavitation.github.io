    Elite TM's allow you to select a specific move or learn exclusive attacks. You can typically earn them as rewards in GO Battle League, or purchase them in Community Day boxes. These Elite TM's open up new and rare movesets! In this article, weâ€™ll take a look at potential
    candidates if you're looking to use a precious Elite TM in your bag.
</p>
<p>
    Note that not all exclusive moves are available via Elite TM, in particular moves that Pokemon never learned in the main series games. These include Mud Shot Golem and and Mud Shot Dugtrio. Also note that Elite TM's cannot remove Frustration from Shadow Pokemon, and can't be used to obtain or remember Return.

  <h3 class="article-header">Priority Exclusve Moves</h3>
<div class="article-section">
	<p>These Pokemon are top contenders in their respective leagues and excellent Elite TM options. Many of them are exclusive Community Day moves, which may be obtained during special events throughout the year or during the December Community Day recap.</p>

	<h3>Swampert</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Leagues:</b> All<br>
		<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Hydro Cannon
	</p>
	<p>Since Swampert has learned Hydro Cannon, it's been a contender in every league. Swampert has the most play in Great and Ultra League; Master League play is usually limited to special formats like Premier Classic. Hydro Cannon is an incredibly powerful Water-type move, and Swampert charges it with blinding speed thanks to Mud Shot. Swampert can compete in regular form or as a Shadow Pokemon; both are top picks and have their advantages and drawbacks.</p>

	<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	<h3>Venusaur</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Leagues:</b> Great, Ultra<br>
		<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Frenzy Plant
	</p>
	<p>Frenzy Plant is one of the strongest Charged Moves in the game and Venusaur benefits from fantastic Grass/Poison typing, which helps it reign over its fellow Grass types. Venusaur is a longtime meta staple, mostly in Great League, and pairs well with Pokemon such as Galarian Stunfisk or Bastiodon.</p>

	<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	<h3>Walrein</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Leagues:</b> Great, Ultra, Master<br>
		<b>Exclusive Fast Move:</b> Powder Snow<br>
		<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Icicle Spear
	</p>
	<p>Walrein crashed into the meta when it received its Community Day moves in January 2022. It has play in all three leagues, but is particularly dominant in the Ultra League's Premier Classic format. Walrein wants both Powder Snow and Icicle Spear to compete. It fast energy generation, low energy Ice type attacks, and powerful Earthquake coverage to make for strong neutral play against the meta.</p>

	<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	<h3>Mewtwo</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Leagues:</b> Master<br>
		<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Psystrike and/or Shadow Ball
	</p>
	<p>Mewtwo combines an immense Attack stat, fast energy generation, and a strong movepool to make for one of the most powerful and dynamic picks in Master League. Psystrike is mandatory as Mewtwo's lowest energy move. It can be paired with Mewtow's other exclusive move, Shadow Ball, or any of its coverage moves (usually Focus Blast or Ice Beam). Mewtwo can compete in regular form or as a Shadow Pokemon, although its regular form is more reliable in PvP. (<i>Never purify your Shadow Mewtwo!</i>)</p>

	<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	<h3>Metagross</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Leagues:</b> Master<br>
		<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Meteor Mash
	</p>
	<p>Metagross serves an important role in Master League countering top threats such as Zacian and Dialga. In other formats such as Premier Classic, Metagross is a top threat in its own right. Meteor Mash is necessary for Metagross to compete, providing a lower energy Charged Move and excellent damage output.</p>

	<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	<h3>Registeel</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Leagues:</b> Great, Ultra<br>
		<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Zap Cannon<br>
	</p>
	<p>Registeel's supreme energy generation and bulk combine to make Zap Cannon terrifyingly effective, especially in open Ultra League. Zap Cannon is a hard-hitting Electric-type Charged Move that lowers the opponent's Attack, making Registeel even more difficult to KO. It also targets that could previously wall Registeel, such as Jellicent and Talonflame. Zap Cannon should be paired with Focus Blast to fend against common counters like Galarian Stunfisk.</p>

	<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	<h3>Talonflame</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Leagues:</b> Great, Ultra<br>
		<b>Exclusive Fast Move:</b> Incinerate<br>
	</p>
	<p>Incinerate bolsters Talonflame's ability to boost itself with Flame Charge, and deliver crushing knock-out hits with Brave Bird. Talonflame is particularly dominant in Ultra League, where few Pokemon resist both of its attacks. Incinerate is the longest Fast Move in the game (5 turns), so if you're uncomfortable playing longer moves like Confusion or Volt Switch, it may not be the right Pokemon for you.</p>

	<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	<h3>Ho-Oh</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Leagues:</b> Ultra, Master<br>
		<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Earthquake or Sacred Fire
	</p>
	<p>Ho-Oh became a top pick in Master League once it gained access to Incinerate and its first exclusive move, Earthquake. Ho-Oh plays similarly to Talonflame and pairs Earthquake or Sacred Fire with the hard-hitting move Brave Bird. Earthquake generally has superior coverage but Sacred Fire is more powerful in neutral matchups and has a chance to debuff the opponent, swinging matchups that Earthquake can't. Ho-Oh is one of the most technically challenging Pokemon to play, so be prepared for a steep learning curve if you choose to train one.</p>

	<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	<h3>Lugia</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Leagues:</b> Ultra, Master<br>
		<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Aeroblast
	</p>
	<p>Lugia's exclusive move, Aeroblast, is one of the hardest hitting moves in the game, and Lugia backs it up with the highest stats of almost any Master League Pokemon. Lugia most often plays as a safe switch in Master League thanks to its generally neutral matchups and its ability to shrug off even super effective hits. Lugia can compete in regular form or as a Shadow Pokemon, although its regular form is more reliable in PvP.</p>

	<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	<h3>Umbreon</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Leagues:</b> Great, Ultra<br>
		<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Last Resort<br>
	</p>
	<p>Umbreon is an extremely bulky Pokemon, able to absorb tons of damage in both Great and Ultra League. Its exclusive move, Last Resort, isn't very powerful but helps Umbreon deliver neutral hits against Fairy types like Azumarill, or against other Dark types. Psychic is another exclusive option for Umbreon, but it generally struggles as a generalist without the neutral play that Last Resort provides.</p>

	<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

	<h3>Cresselia</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Leagues:</b> Great, Ultra<br>
		<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Grass Knot<br>
	</p>
	<p>Cresselia is bulky Psychic type and a longtime meta staple in Ultra League. Grass Knot is its fastest move and gives it an upper hand against Water types such as Swampert and Walrein. Grass Knot is recommended for Great League Cresselia to hit Azumarill. Cresselia must be obtained from special research or traded to fall under 1500 CP.</p>

  <h3 class="article-header">Other</h3>
<div class="article-section">

		<h3>Charizard</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Leagues:</b> Great, Ultra<br>
			<b>Exclusive Fast Move:</b> Wing Attack or Dragon Breath<br>
			<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Blast Burn<br>
		</p>
		<p>Charizard's exclusive move, Blast Burn, is extremely powerful. As a Fire type, Charizard can struggle in open formats but has the most play in limited cups like Love Cup or Ultra Premier Classic. Blast Burn is mandatory to give Charizard its closing power, while exclusive Fast Moves such as Wing Attack or Dragon Breath are optional. Wing Attack provides Charizard with its fastest energy generation while Dragon Breath gives it more play against specific targets like Giratina or Dragonite.</p>

		<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

		<h3>Lickitung</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Leagues:</b> Great<br>
			<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Body Slam<br>
		</p>
		<p>Lickitung rose to relevancy with the level 50 update. Its high bulk and Body Slam spam make it a safe pick in Great League that synergizes well with other meta staples, such as Medicham. An XL Lickitung is a costly investment, so if you're on the way to building one, Elite TM's are probably the least of your challenges!</p>

		<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

		<h3>Groudon</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Leagues:</b> Master<br>
			<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Fire Punch<br>
		</p>
		<p>Groudon is a powerful option for Master League, and Fire Punch plays a critical role in its viability. Fire Punch is Groudon's cheapest move, which gives Groudon the opportunity to spam or bait for its bigger move, Earthquake. Groudon is viable with both the energy generation of Mud Shot or the power of Dragon Tail as generalist.</p>

		<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

		<h3>Zapdos</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Leagues:</b> Great<br>
			<b>Exclusive Fast Move:</b> Thunder Shock
		</p>
		<p>Zapdos is mostly shunned from open league play thanks to the overwhelming presence of Galarian Stunfisk, but it's a dynamic glass cannon that can be fun and rewarding to play. Zapdos has excellent defensive typing, and it needs all the help it can get because it can't take a hit. Its speed will surprise both you and your opponent, and it has powerful Charged Moves to boot in Drill Peck, Thunderbolt, or Thunder. Thunder Shock Zapdos is unique among other Pokemon of its types and can shine in the occassional themed cup.</p>

		<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

		<h3>Lapras</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Leagues:</b> Great, Ultra<br>
			<b>Exclusive Fast Move:</b> Ice Shard<br>
			<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Ice Beam<br>
		</p>
		<p>Lapras is comparable to Walrein, and trades coverage for extra bulk and Water-flavored attacks. Ice Shard is mandatory in most formats, while Ice Beam is optional and usually dropped in favor of Skull Bash; Skull Bash increases Lapras's already high defenses and gives it neutral play against other Water types.</p>

		<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

		<h3>Dewgong</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Leagues:</b> Great<br>
			<b>Exclusive Fast Move:</b> Ice Shard<br>
			<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Icy Wind<br>
		</p>
		<p>Double legacy Dewgong can frustrate your opponent with its bulk and Attack drops. Walrein is more popular, but Dewgong can still make a strong showing especially in themed cups. Ice Shard and Icy Wind are mandatory together to turn Dewgong into an oppressive debuff machine. The exclusive Charged Move Aqua Jet is not recommended, since Water Pulse is slightly better.</p>

		<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


		<h3>Seaking</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Leagues:</b> Great, Ultra<br>
			<b>Exclusive Fast Move:</b> Poison Jab<br>
			<b>Exclusive Charged Move:</b> Icy Wind and Drill Run<br>
		</p>
		<p>Triple legacy Seaking is a spice unicorn! While it doesn't offer much play in open leagues, it can find niches in special formats like Love Cup. Seaking packs off-typing moves to give it an interesting damage profile with debuff ability and wide coverage. It's slightly lacking in bulk and speed, however, so it may underperform compared to similar Pokemon like Dewgong.</p>
